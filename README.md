# SysShell
SysShell is a lightweight shell written in C. It includes three source code files: 'csapp.h', 'csapp.c', and 'shellex.c', along with a Makefile for compilation.

# Makefile 
The Makefile for SysShell provides a convenient way to compile and manage the project. It includes rules for building the executable, cleaning up generated files, and ensuring a smooth development workflow.

## Requirements
To build and run SysShell, you will need:

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- 'make'

## Usage
### Build
To compile SysShell, run the following command:
```
make
```
This will compile the program using the 'gcc' compiler and create an executable file named 'sh257'.

### Run
To execute SysShell, use the following command:
```
./sh257
```

### Clean
To remove the executable and object files, use the following command:
```
make clean
```
This will remove the 'sh257' executable as well as any object files created during compilation.
